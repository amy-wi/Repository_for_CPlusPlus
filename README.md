# Repository for C++ Code

In this repository, you will find some c++ source files along with their corresponding executables. If you want or need to compile the executables yourself please insure you have c++ downloaded and use the following command `g++ -o filename filename.cpp`.

## As of February 2024, I have uploaded 3 examples (in order of complexity): 

*Hello* which contains a script to print the string "Hello from C++".

*Condition* which takes a positive integer and returns a string describing whether it is less than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 100, or between 10 and 100 non inclusive.

*Funcs* which contains 5 functions which then have a corresponding "main scope". The functions are for adding positive integers, printing strings, squaring doubles, joining strings, and printing the string "Hello World".
